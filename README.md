## FAQ and thoughts
- I used Nylas as my mail integration.
- Deleting labels is not implemented yet.
- Design is minimal to allow basic functionality.
- I used Next.js for a fast MVP but the FE and BE can be separated easily.
- Basic cache was used for the labels fetching to reduce load on the api.
- This project was a nice *mail app* POC
- To-do: Add tests.
- Thanks for reading ðŸ˜Š

## Basic technical flow
### Login
- After pushing Login button user is redirecting to `api/v1/login`
- A link for login is generated then the server is redirecting the user to Google's SSO flow, its includes a callback to `api/v1/oauth`
- Google redirect the user after successful login to `api/v1/oauth`.
- The server generates a grant id for this user and returns a cookie with the id for later use.

### Mail list
- The app uses the cookie to detect a logged user.
- Using `/api/v1/folders` app is getting the labels for later use. (this data is cached on localStorage)
- The app showing today's emails, `api/v1/emails` is used.
- When changing the date the same api is used but with `forDate` param.
- Users can choose new labels for email from the list we have on cache.
- a PUT request to `/api/v1/messages/[id]` will save the new change.
- User can reload the data.
